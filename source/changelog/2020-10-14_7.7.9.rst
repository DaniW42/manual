* `python v3.9 <https://docs.python.org/3.9/whatsnew/3.9.html>`_
* `tig <https://jonas.github.io/tig/>`_

Fixed
-----

* Apache workers are now restarted after a number of requests to ensure the web
  sever's RAM usage does not grow unreasonably fast. This increases stability
  overall.

Internal
--------

* PHP errors for accounts were logged globally by accident. They are now never
  logged globally. But still user-local, if the user enables them.
